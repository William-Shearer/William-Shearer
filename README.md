Additional info:  
I am an old guy. I have been hobby programming in various (many) languages and on several platforms since 1986. I do not work as a programmer, though knowledge of it has often helped me in what work I did do, quite extensively. Obtaining "official" programming certificates with HarvardX was merely closing the circle of something that turned out to be a life-long interest, which all those years ago I thought was only a passing phase. I was wrong.  
Best wishes to anyone who visits here.
