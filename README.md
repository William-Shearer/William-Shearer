Additional info:  
I am an old guy. I have been hobby programming in various (many) languages and on several platforms since 1986. I do not work as a programmer, though knowledge of it has often helped me in what other work I did, quite extensively. Obtaining "official" programming certificates with HarvardX is merely closing the circle of something that turned out to be a life-long interest. 
Best wishes to anyone who visits here.
